OtherGrowth
===========
OtherGrowth lets you bring your world to life by creating "recipies" that change blocks based on the surrounding blocks - such as "cobble to mossy-cobble near water" (grow mossy-cobble) or "air to leaves near grass" (add a unique feeling to plains) and much much more.

Ideas
=====
Use OtherGrowth to spread wool over desert, add leaves & water in the nether and grow bookshelves on trees - there's a lot of crazy stuff you can do.

OtherGrowth can add a deeper feel to the world with roads that fall apart & castles that become overgrown with leaves and deteriorate (stone->gravel->dirt). Finding an older building that hasn't been maintained is more interesting with cobwebs gathering in corners and many of the blocks possibly infested with silverfish.
